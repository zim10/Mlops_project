Description: # MWC-Module-3-Modular-Workflow-and-Project-Setup-Basics
        
        # Problem Statement:
        
        ## Business Context:
        
        
        The project aims to develop a machine learning system that predicts individual income levels based on demographic and employment data.
        
        The prediction boundary is set at $50,000 annually (binary classification problem).
        
        The solution will help in understanding socio-economic factors affecting income levels.
        
        Enable data-driven decision making for policy makers and financial institutions.
        
        Identify key socio-economic factors influencing income disparities.
        
        Support targeted intervention programs for economic development
        
        ## Key Stakeholders
        
        **Policy Makers:** For evidence-based policy development
        
        **Financial Institutions:** For risk assessment and product development
        
        **Social Services:** For resource allocation and program planning
        
        **Research Organizations:** For socio-economic studies
        
        # Dataset Details:
        Let's visualize the data structure and features:
